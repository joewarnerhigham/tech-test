Built using react with testing utilities Jest and React testing libraries.

Packages used: Axios, PropTypes

clone the repo, 
in the root folder
npm start - runs the app.
npm test - tests the app.

In the future I would think about adding more styling and making it more user friendly, as well as better testing.
